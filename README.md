# FTP-Client:

An FTP client is software that uses the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to connect to an FTP server. This allows users to upload, download, manage, and organize files stored on a remote server. FTP is a common protocol for file transfer, and an FTP client provides a user-friendly interface for these tasks.
